Odin Project etch-a-sketch!

The odin project didn't mention jack about regular 'display: grid', so I revolted and didn't submit like the rest of the projects to going out of kilter and using that technique. Yeah, they definitely expect us to learn it for ourselves, but you know what... weak. Although, it definitely would've made things 100% cleaner and easier. I'll probably be back to clean this mush of a project up later.
